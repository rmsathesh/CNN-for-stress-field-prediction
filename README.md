# CNN-for-stress-field-prediction

This project is developed to predict the stress field in solid material elastic deformation using convolutional neural network. A Squeeze and Excitation residual blocks embedded fully convolutional neural network with multiple input channels (consisting of geometry, loads & boundary conditions) was developed to accurately predict the stress field. 

Below paper was taken as a reference for this model.
'Nie, Zhenguo & Jiang, Haoliang & Kara, Levent. (2018). Deep Learning for Stress Field Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Networks.'

Model architecture was fine tuned a bit to reduce computational load. Results showed good correlation with the ground truth value.
